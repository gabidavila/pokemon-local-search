# Pokemón Local Search

This is a `vanilla.js` implementation using the data from the [Pokémon Api](https://pokeapi.co).

Currently the search does partial match, shows the images of the Pokémon (front and back) and shows the results paginated in groups of 12 items.

## Tested on

* Chrome (>= 60)
* Opera (>= 47)
* Safari for macOS (>= 10.1)
* Firefox (>= 55)

## ToDo

* Integrate with Pokemón API to get more detailed data
